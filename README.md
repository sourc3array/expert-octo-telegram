# 808 Tape Kit Overview

The **808 Tape Kit** features sixteen (16) individual sound pads optimized for use with 4x4 MIDI pad controller layouts and finger drumming:

  - **DRUMS**: Kick (Sub), Kick, Low Tom and High Tom
  - **SNARES**: Snare, Snare (Alt), Rim and Clap
  - **HI-HATS**: Closed Hat, Closed Hat (Alt), Mid Hat and Open Hat
  - **CYMBALS**: Crash and Crash (Alt)
  - **PERCUSSION**: Clave and Maracas (FX)

All pads feature a Master Volume control. The Master Volume (V) for each pad is adjustable through the *Controls* interface of your SFZ plug-in or stand-alone player. Additionally, all Master Volumes are linked to Continuous Controllers (CCs) for automation in DAWs, linking to hardware MIDI controllers, live performance, etc.

All cymbals implement muting for enhanced realism and playability. Hi-hats feature an additional Tight control (T) that varies the openness of the Mid Hat.
